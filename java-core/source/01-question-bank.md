You have been given a design document for a veterinary registration system for implementation in Java. It states:

"A pet has an owner, a registration date, and a vaccination-due date. A cat
is a pet that has a flag indicating if it has been neutered, and a textual description of its markings."
Given that the Pet class has already been defined and you expect the Cat class to be used freely throughout the application, how would you make the opening declaration of the Cat class, up
to but not including the first opening brace? Use only these words and spaces: boolean, Cat, class, Date, extends, Object, Owner, Pet, private, protected, public, String.
